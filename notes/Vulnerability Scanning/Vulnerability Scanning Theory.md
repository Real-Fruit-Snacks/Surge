## Vulnerability Scanning Concepts
resources: [HackTricks - Vulnerability Assessment](https://book.hacktricks.wiki/en/generic-methodologies-and-resources/pentesting-methodology.html)

> [!info] Automated scanners follow this workflow:
> 1. Host Discovery
> 2. Port Scanning
> 3. OS/Service/Version Detection
> 4. Match results to vulnerability database (NVD, CVE)

### Key Terms
> [!important] Key vulnerability scanning terms:
> - **CVE** - Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures, unique identifier for vulnerabilities
> - **CVSS** - Common Vulnerability Scoring System, severity rating 0-10
> - **False Positive** - Vulnerability detected but target is not actually vulnerable
> - **False Negative** - Vulnerability exists but scanner missed it

### CVSS v3.0 Severity Ratings
> CVSS severity levels:
> - **None**: 0.0
> - **Low**: 0.1-3.9
> - **Medium**: 4.0-6.9
> - **High**: 7.0-8.9
> - **Critical**: 9.0-10.0

### Scan Types by Location
> Scan types based on network position:
> - **External** - Targets accessible from internet (web apps, DMZ, public services)
> - **Internal** - Direct access to internal network (VPN or on-site)

### Scan Types by Authentication
> Scan types based on credentials:
> - **Unauthenticated** - No credentials, finds remotely accessible vulnerabilities only
> - **Authenticated** - Uses valid credentials, finds local security flaws, missing patches, misconfigs. Provides much better visibility but requires privileged credentials

### Scan Considerations
> [!warning] Important scan considerations:
> - **Duration** - External scans over internet are slower due to network hops. Plan accordingly for large IP lists
> - **Target Visibility** - Consider firewalls, IPS, VPNs, and access restrictions. ICMP may be blocked causing hosts to appear offline. Rate limiting can cause missed hosts/services
> - **Network Impact** - Vulnerability scans generate heavy traffic. Can render networks unusable or crash unstable services. Reduce parallel scans or scanning speed if needed
