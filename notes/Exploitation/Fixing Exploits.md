## Fixing Web Exploits

> Web exploits are easier to modify than memory corruption. Check: protocol (HTTP/HTTPS), paths, authentication, SSL verification, CSRF tokens.

### Key Questions
> [!info] Before running a web exploit, verify:
> - Does it use HTTP or HTTPS?
> - Does it require authentication? What credentials?
> - Are there hardcoded paths that may differ?
> - Will self-signed certificates cause issues?

### Python requests - Disable SSL Verification
```python
response = requests.post(url, data=data, verify=False)
```

### Common Issues
> [!warning] Typical errors when running public exploits:
> - **IndexError: list index out of range** - Usually means a parameter name changed between versions. Add print statements to debug.
> - **SSL Errors** - Add `verify=False` to requests calls.
> - **Authentication Failures** - Check credential format and CSRF token handling.

### Debugging Python Exploits
> [!tip] Add print statements before failing lines to see actual values.

```python
print("[+] Debug: " + variable_name)
```
