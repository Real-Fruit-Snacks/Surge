## IDA Pro Disassembler
resources: [IDA Pro Documentation](https://hex-rays.com/documentation/)

> **IDA Pro** is the industry-standard disassembler for static analysis and reverse engineering.

### Loading a Binary
> Open a file for analysis in IDA Pro.

```text
File -> Open (or drag file onto IDA)
Select appropriate processor type (usually auto-detected)
Click OK to begin analysis
```

### Navigation Shortcuts
> Move through the disassembly efficiently.

```text
G           ; Go to address (enter address or symbol)
Ctrl+E      ; Jump to entry point
Ctrl+X      ; Jump to cross-reference
Esc         ; Return to previous location
Ctrl+Enter  ; Jump to address under cursor
```

### View Modes
> Switch between different analysis views.

```text
Space       ; Toggle between graph and text view
Tab         ; Switch to Hex view
F5          ; Decompile function (if Hex-Rays available)
```

### Renaming Items
> Improve readability by renaming functions and variables.

```text
N           ; Rename address/function/variable
;           ; Add comment at current address
:           ; Add repeatable comment
Ins         ; Add anterior comment (before line)
```

### Cross-References (XRefs)
> Find where functions or data are referenced.

```text
X           ; List cross-references to current item
Ctrl+X      ; Jump to cross-reference
```

### Function Operations
> Work with function definitions.

```text
P           ; Create function at cursor
U           ; Undefine (convert to bytes)
C           ; Convert to code
D           ; Convert to data
A           ; Convert to ASCII string
```

### Search Functions
> Find specific content in the binary.

```text
Alt+T       ; Text search in disassembly
Alt+B       ; Binary/byte sequence search
Ctrl+F      ; Search in current view
Alt+I       ; Search for immediate value
```

### Search for String
> Locate strings in the binary.

```text
View -> Open Subviews -> Strings (Shift+F12)
Double-click string to navigate to it
Use Ctrl+F to filter string list
```

### Search for Imports
> Find imported functions.

```text
View -> Open Subviews -> Imports
Locate function (e.g., recv, strcpy)
Double-click to navigate
X to find cross-references
```

### Synchronize with WinDbg
> [!tip] Link **IDA** static analysis with **WinDbg** dynamic debugging:
> 1. In WinDbg: `lm m <module>` to get base address
> 2. In IDA: Edit -> Segments -> Rebase program
> 3. Enter the runtime base address from WinDbg
> 4. Addresses now match between IDA and WinDbg

### Calculate Rebased Address
> Convert between IDA and WinDbg addresses.

```text
Runtime Address = IDA Address - IDA Base + WinDbg Base
IDA Address = Runtime Address - WinDbg Base + IDA Base
```

### Common Windows API to Find
> [!important] Functions often involved in vulnerabilities:
> - **strcpy, strcat, sprintf**: Buffer overflow candidates
> - **memcpy, memmove**: Size-related overflows
> - **recv, read**: Network input handling
> - **fgets, gets**: File/stdin input
> - **CreateFileA, ReadFile**: File operations

### Graph Overview
> Use the graph view for function structure.

```text
Space           ; Toggle graph/text view
+/-             ; Zoom in/out in graph
Ctrl+Mouse      ; Pan around graph
Overview Window ; Minimap of current function
```

### Exports Window
> View exported functions from a DLL.

```text
View -> Open Subviews -> Exports
Useful for finding entry points and exported APIs
```

### Apply Structure Types
> Define structures for better analysis.

```text
T           ; Set type for variable
Y           ; Change function prototype
Insert      ; Add structure member (in Structures view)
```
